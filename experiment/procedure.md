**Procedure**
1. Examine the hardness testing machine.
2. Place the specimen on platform of a machine. Using the elevating screw, raise the platform and
bring the specimen just in contact with the ball. Apply an initial load until the small pointer points to the red mark.
3. Release the operating valve to apply additional load. Immediately after the additional load is
applied, bring back operating valve to its position.
4. Read the position of the pointer on the C scale, which gives the hardness number.
5. Repeat the procedure five times on the specimen selecting different points for indentation.

**Virtual Procedure**
1. Start the experiment by clicking the play button.
2. Observe the movement of top knob and pressure applied by it on the test specimen.
3. The top knob creates a hole in the test specimen and the load used is observed.
4. An observation table is provided with different trials and mean rockwell hardness number is calculated.
5. The experiment allows you to pause/play/restart the simulation to view the values of different parameters at every stage of simulation.
