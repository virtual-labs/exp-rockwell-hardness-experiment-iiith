- Perform the tensile yield test with the pp dumbbell specimens and evaluate the
yield point from the resulting stress-strain curve.

- Mount the fixture on the tensile tester and perform the shear yield test with the pp
strip specimens.

- Construct the corresponding Tresca’s hexagon and the von Mises’ ellipse and
demonstrate the validity of these yield criteria.
